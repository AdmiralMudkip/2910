Game Title: Frantic Frigate

Overview: 

Frantic Frigate is a grid based brain-game that tests the player's memory and problem solving skills. The goal of the game is to get from one side of the grid to the other while collecting the treasure chests without dying. 

After briefly being shown explosive barrels dropping into the water, then sinking out of view, the player is given control of a boat, and must navigate to the goal point (an island) while avoiding the barrel's tiles by memory. Treasure chests may be collected along the way for extra points. The difficulty increases throughout the levels by extending the boundaries of the game grid.

Code:

The game's assets are sorted throughout several folders. Sprites, levels, and win and lose screens can be found in the 'art' folder, while the 'image' folder contains the various menus. The game's sound effects and music are contained in the 'sound' folder.

The actual code is held in the main folder, '2910'. The game's main html file is called 'FranticFrigate.html'. It has the page's styling, images, canvas, a timer. The scripts used by the main code are 'script2.js', 'menus.js', 'timer.js', 'highscore.js', as well as an external script. 'script2.js' holds most of the javascript code, such as setting up levels, wins/losses, controls, and sounds. 'menu.js' contains the coding for the menu and ui buttons, as well as the muting and retart functions. The timer code is found in 'timer.js', and 'highscore.js' contains the code for highscore saving and posting.     
'AdamTesting.html', 'KaranTesting.html','NickTesting', and 'menuNick.js' were all used for individual team member's testing and experimenting.
'Sample Code' is a folder that contains code used for experimenting and testing, and as a reference. 

Technologies:

The various technologies used during the game's development were HTML5, JavaScript, JQuery, and CSS. Programs such as PhotoShop were used for art assets; sprites, menus, and levels. The team communicated with eachother using Facebook, and Google drive, which we also used to post assets, as well as documents and presentations to be worked on. GitHub and WebMatrix were used to share and recieve eachother's code.

Issues:

Throughout development of the game we ran into numerous bugs and issues. Current bugs the game may have are problems with music, displaced arrow touch controls, an inoperative mute button, and the restart button taking the player back to the first level. Some of the bugs we previously corrected were map array issues, problems with object placement in levels, malfunctioning level transitions, and multiple issues with Git and WebMatrix.
